        <h1 class="hero">The new math: Solving cryptography in an age of quantum</h1>
        <p>
          Quantum computers are likely to pose a severe threat to today’s
          encryption practices. Updating encryption has never been more urgent.

        <p>
          Cybersecurity professionals face a wide array of immediate threats,
          from social engineering hacks to the risks posed by AI-generated
          content. However, they may be overlooking a potentially catastrophic
          long-term risk: the advent of a cryptographically relevant quantum
          computer (CRQC). Once such a computer becomes operational, it could
          break much of the public-key cryptography that underpins secure online
          sessions, transaction verifications, and user identity assurance.
          While the precise arrival of a CRQC remains uncertain, experts
          generally predict it could emerge within the next five to ten years.
          This creates a dilemma for organizations, as they acknowledge the
          importance of preparing for the risk but often delay action due to the
          unknown timescale, leading to complacency.

        <h2 id="section2">New: Upgrading to a quantum-safe future</h2>
        <p>
          The consequences of this delay could be devastating, as the
          infrastructure and systems relying on current cryptographic methods
          would become vulnerable. Major disruptions could occur, with digital
          signatures and secure data exchanges no longer being reliable,
          undermining both the integrity and security of communications and
          transactions. To combat this, organizations must begin proactive
          preparations to adopt quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, as
          emphasized by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Many
          enterprises are already assessing the risk posed by quantum computing
          and implementing risk strategies. With tools like post-quantum
          cryptography (PQC) standards from NIST, there are solutions available
          now to address these emerging threats, but a more widespread awareness
          and urgency are needed.

        <h2 id="section3">Next: Leveraging postquantum cryptography to prepare for future threats</h2>
        <p>
          Two of the primary concerns for cybersecurity teams are technology
          integrity and operational disruption.6 Undermining digital signatures
          and cryptographic key exchanges that enable data encryption are at the
          heart of those fears. Losing the type of cryptography that can
          guarantee digital signatures are authentic and unaltered would likely
          deal a major blow to the integrity of communications and transactions.
          Additionally, losing the ability to transmit information securely
          could potentially upend most organizational processes.

          Enterprises are starting to become aware of the risks posed by quantum
          computing to their cybersecurity. According to Deloitte’s Global
          Future of Cyber survey, 52% of organizations are currently assessing
          their exposure and developing quantum-related risk strategies. Another
          30% say they are currently taking decisive action to implement
          solutions to these risks.

          “The scale of this problem is sizeable, and its impact in the future
          is imminent. There may still be time when it hits us, but proactive
          measures now will help avoid a crisis later. That is the direction we
          need to take,” says Gomeet Pant, group vice president of security
          technologies for the India-based division of a large industrial
          products firm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cryptography is now so pervasive that many organizations may need help
          identifying all the places it appears. It’s in applications they own
          and manage, and in their partner and vendor systems. Understanding the
          full scope of the organizational risk that a CRQC would pose to
          cryptography requires action across a wide range of
          infrastructures, supply chains, and applications. Cryptography used
          for data confidentiality and digital signatures to maintain the
          integrity of emails, macros, electronic documents, and user
          authentication would all be threatened, undermining the integrity and
          authenticity of digital communications.
